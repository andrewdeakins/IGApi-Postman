# IGApi-Postman
Postman Collection for the IG Forex API

Simple collection for postman, 

1. import the IG Demo Environment and set the variables for API key, api username and api password
2. import the postman collection and your good to go (hit the login request first)


NOTE: If you are struggling on the auth side, you may have created a different un/pw combination for the api as this suggested:


"Thanks for the replies guys, It turns out I had to create different username and password as edada suggested, although I can't remember reading this anywhere in the documentation but then again I could have easily missed that info.

But in case someone comes cross this issue , you just have to go to classic platform under demo account ( important to do this under demo platform otherwise you won't see this option) and set demo username and password where you set your demo API keys."

Im giving this with no warrenty whatsoever, Im not responsible for IG locking you out if you hammer their servers or if you wind up placing trades that were not intended.  Thanks for understanding.
